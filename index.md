# About me

I am a PhD student in clinical Natural Language Processing at the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics (CLiPS) Research Center, University of Antwerp, Belgium. My research interest is to apply machine learning algorithms to understand natural language text. At the same time, I am also inspired to understand the behavior of trained neural networks to make them more interpretable. My current focus involves clinical text understanding using deep learning techniques. In particular, I am investigating different document representation techniques to learn semantic representations at the patient level, along with model-agnostic interpretability techniques to understand these models and representations.

I have a Master's of Science in Language Science and Technology (spec. Language Technology) from Saarland University, Germany, and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, India. 

I have also worked as a Junior Research Developer at the Antwerp University Hospital, Belgium, and as a Research Assistant at the German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbrücken, Germany.
