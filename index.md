# About me

I am a PhD student in clinical Natural Language Processing at the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics (CLiPS) Research Center, University of Antwerp, Belgium. My PhD supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Walter Daelemans](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/) and [Dr. Simon Šuster](http://simonsuster.github.io/). My research interest is to apply machine learning algorithms to understand natural language text. At the same time, I am also inspired to understand the behavior of trained neural networks to make them more interpretable. My current focus involves clinical text understanding using deep learning techniques. In particular, I am investigating different document representation techniques to learn semantic representations at the patient level, along with model-agnostic interpretability techniques to understand these models and representations.

I hold a Master of Science in Language Science and Technology (spec. Language Technology) from Saarland University, Germany, and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, India.

Previously, I have worked on clinical text understanding also as a Junior Research Developer at the Antwerp University Hospital, Belgium. Furthermore, I have worked towards recognizing textual entailment as a Research Assistant at the German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbrücken, Germany.
