# About me

I am postdoctoral researcher at University of California, San Francisco in the [Butte Lab](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/). I have obtained a PhD in clinical Natural Language Processing at the [Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics (CLiPS) Research Center](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/), University of Antwerp, Belgium, under [Prof. Dr. Walter Daelemans](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/) and [Dr. Simon Šuster](http://simonsuster.github.io/). My research interest is to develop foundation models to understand the nuances in electronic health record data, and to use these insights for answering clinical research questions. I am particularly interested in developing strategies for inferring causal patterns from observational textual data, improving generalization for low frequency data samples, and developing multi-modal and interpretable foundation models to improve the understanding of patients' disease and treatment trajectory. I have extensive experience with the development of methodology for deep learning model interpretability and retrieval-augmented classification, and in creating benchmarking datasets for advanced oncology-specific information extraction from clinical notes.

During my PhD, I have worked as a research intern at the Google Brain Applied team in Zurich, where I investigated linguistic reasoning skills of BERT representations. I have additionally been involved in several academic service positions throughout. I hold a Master of Science in Language Science and Technology (spec. Language Technology) from Saarland University, Germany, and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, India. I have additionally worked on clinical text understanding as a Junior Research Developer at the Antwerp University Hospital, Belgium, and contributed towards recognizing textual entailment for the EU-funded [Excitement](https://sites.google.com/site/excitementproject/) project as a Research Assistant at the German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbrücken, Germany.
